# Autonomoues_robot_in_Hospital
This project demonstrates the implementation of an autonomous navigation robot in the hospital environment. This system employs Gmapping for map creation, AMCL for localization, and the  package for path planning. A custom Python script, go\textunderscore to\textunderscore room.py enables the robot to navigate to predefined rooms.
